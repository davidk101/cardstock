// Delegation allows objects to be able to change their appearance / state based on dynamic changes
// Delegation is often achieved by using protocols, since it allows the delegate object to be of any class
// Delegation is also very useful when you want to pass information between objects. You can very easily create your own protocols and sign up your own objects to follow them
